Hi, I'm Zul 👋🏻

I'm currently studying a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University, Australia, I’m driven to become an empowered person, learning not just to consume insights, but to create them. Through evidence-based, ethical, and reproducible data practices, I’m developing the analytical and computational skills to turn complex information into meaningful solutions for real-world challenges.

Before this journey, I built my professional foundation in Indonesia’s energy sector, working for several years in Human Capital field. I also hold degrees in Industrial Engineering and Law, which together shaped my ability to connect technical, human, and regulatory perspectives.

I’m passionate about applying data-driven approaches to solve human capital problems, helping organizations align people strategy, business performance, and long-term sustainability. My work sits at the intersection of analytics, leadership, and purpose, bridging people and numbers to drive lasting impact.

Outside of study and work, I enjoy running, swimming, going to the gym, and traveling, activities that keep me balanced, curious, and inspired.
