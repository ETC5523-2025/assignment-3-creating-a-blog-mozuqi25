Do we really need a DNA test every time we want to prove that someone is related to their parents? A DNA test surely gives the most precise answer, but it also costs time and money. In many cases, simpler clues, like matching blood type, similar eye color, or shared facial traits, are already strong indicators of family connection. They may not be perfect, but when considered together, they paint a convincing picture.

River scientists face a somewhat similar challenge, except theirs is about keeping up with change, nitrate levels can fluctuate by the minute, so measurements need to be nearly continuous. The dedicated nitrate sensors that can do this are expensive, demanding to maintain, and still only capture readings every 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, other water-quality sensors, such as those measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, and turbidity, are far cheaper and can record data every minute. By combining signals from these faster, easier instruments, researchers can estimate nitrate levels with impressive accuracy, giving them a near-continuous view of nitrate dynamics without relying solely on the costly nitrate sensor.

It’s a bit like reading the river’s family resemblance through its traits rather than sequencing its DNA. This approach, demonstrated in a 2023 study by Kermorvant et al. published in PLOS ONE, shows that smart modeling using affordable sensors can explain up to 99% of nitrate variation, a breakthrough that could transform how we monitor water quality around the world.

### Problem Description

Monitoring nitrate in rivers is crucial for understanding how freshwater ecosystems function and respond to change. Nitrate levels can fluctuate rapidly with rainfall, sunlight, and the activity of living organisms in the water. These short-term variations influence oxygen balance, algal growth, and the overall chemical stability of river systems.

To capture such dynamics, scientists use optical instruments like the `SUNA V2` nitrate sensor, which records data roughly every 15 minutes. Although this is considered high-frequency compared to traditional manual sampling, the instrument itself is costly, maintenance-intensive, and difficult to deploy widely.

In contrast, rivers are often equipped with other high-frequency sensors that measure parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, specific conductance, turbidity, and water level every minute. These devices are inexpensive, reliable, and produce continuous data streams. If information from these common sensors can be combined to estimate nitrate accurately, it could provide a far more efficient way to monitor river chemistry and fill spatial or temporal data gaps.

The study by Kermorvant et al. (2023) examined this possibility, investigating whether relationships between nitrate and other water-quality variables could be modeled strongly enough to explain nitrate variation across contrasting environments.

Earlier research approached nitrate modeling with different aims and degrees of success. Some studies focused mainly on prediction, using methods such as Artificial Neural Networks or Random Forest Regression, which are powerful but difficult to interpret. Others employed Generalised Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs), which offer interpretability but are restricted to linear relationships.

To overcome these limitations, Kermorvant adopted Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs), a method that preserves interpretability while capturing the non-linear and site-specific dynamics of nitrate in rivers.
Their goal was to build a framework that is both accurate and understandable, capable of revealing how nitrate interacts with key water-quality variables across diverse ecosystems.

# Key Results

## Site characteristics

The study compared three contrasting sites: Arikaree (semi-arid, Colorado), Caribou (subarctic, Alaska), and Lewis Run (temperate, urban/agricultural, Virginia). Initial water-quality conditions varied substantially. Lewis Run has the highest nitrate concentrations, Caribou intermediate, and Arikaree the lowest. Other variables such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductance, and turbidity also displayed distinct patterns across sites.

## Temporal fluctuations

Sensor data revealed both daily diel cycles and responses to flow events. For example, in Caribou nitrate and dissolved oxygen tended to rise during the day, whereas in Arikaree nitrate declined. During flow events, nitrate increased with rising elevation in Arikaree but decreased in Lewis Run.

## Non-linear relationships

The GAM analysis highlighted non-linear and site-specific relationships (see @fig-3). In Caribou, temperature correlated positively with nitrate, while conductivity correlated negatively. In Arikaree, temperature showed a weak negative influence. In Lewis Run, almost all variables were influential, with mostly positive relationships.

## Variable importance

Deviance explained indicated that the relative importance of variables differs among sites (see @fig-4). In Arikaree, water-quality variables contributed little (\<5%) while the ARIMA component explained about 25% of the variance. In Caribou, specific conductance was dominant (\~10%). In Lewis Run, all variables contributed significantly (11–15%), with conductance again strongest.

## Model performance

Using GAMs alone, the models explained about 75–85% of nitrate variation, showing that non-linear relationships with other water-quality variables capture most of the signal. Yet, residuals still showed temporal patterns. By adding ARIMA to model this auto-correlation, the combined GAMMs explained up to 99% of the variation.

Approximate AIC values were consistently lower for GAMMs than for GAMs, confirming that the improvement reflected a better model, not just extra complexity. In short, including the temporal component made the models both more accurate and more reliable.

# Brief Methods

The data came from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), which provides high-frequency in-situ water-quality measurements at three contrasting sites observed. Most variables (temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity, surface water elevation) were measured every 1 minute, while nitrate was measured every 15 minutes using a more costly sensor. To align the datasets, all variables were aggregated to a common 15-minute interval.

The modeling framework was built in two steps:

## 1. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)

-   Nitrate was modeled as a non-linear function of time, temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, turbidity (log-transformed), and surface water elevation.

-   Variable selection was guided by stepwise AIC and multicollinearity was checked using VIF.

## 2. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)

-   GAM residuals were modeled with ARIMA to capture temporal auto-correlation.

-   The optimal ARIMA model varied by site.

The final GAMM combined both components, providing robust and interpretable models of nitrate dynamics. The overall model framework can be expressed as follows:

::: {style="font-size:80%"}

$Nitrate(t)=f(time,temperature,DO,conductance,log(turbidity),surface\ elevation)+ARIMA\ residuals$

:::

Here, $f$ represents smooth non-linear functions estimated by the GAM. The ARIMA residual term models short-term temporal dependence in the series. Time appears as a covariate in the GAM to capture systematic cycles (diel or seasonal patterns), and as the time index $t$ of the series, which ARIMA uses to describe correlations between consecutive observations. The modeling might be computationally intensive, but it remains feasible with available tools and is suitable for applied monitoring.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates that GAMMs are an accurate and interpretable framework for modeling nitrate dynamics in rivers. The approach is practically relevant because it reduces reliance on costly nitrate sensors, allows for imputation of missing data, and can be applied across sites with local recalibration.

For the company, this framework can be integrated into broader water-quality monitoring strategies. Pilot testing with local datasets is recommended to adjust the relationships among variables and confirm the model’s suitability for local ecosystem conditions.
